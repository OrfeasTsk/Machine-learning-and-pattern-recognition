# Project 1 - Gradient Descent & ML Mathematics

In this project the goal is to understand the essential mathematics of machine learning by verifying the results with the numpy library. 
There is also a simulation of gradient decent algorithm for optimizing mathematical functions comparing the results of some experiments done for different parameters as well.

# Project 2 - Face Recognition & Regression Mathematics

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/OrfeasTsk/machine-learning-and-pattern-recognition/blob/main/Face_Recognition_And_Regression_Mathematics.ipynb)

In this project the goal is to understand the mathematics behind regression, especially for the logistic and ridge regression. Also the core of this project is associated with
a face recognition problem using the Yale B dataset. The solution of this problem is implemented from scratch using
the numpy library and it is based on the Eigenfaces method which is a combination of the KNN classification method and the PCA dimensionality reduction method. Also some experiments have been done in order to estimate the efficiency of the Eigenfaces method and to detect possible problems (e.g loss of information).
